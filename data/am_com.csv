&gt;No one in public life has been more intellectually engaged in helping to create the climate for a thriving Internet than the Vice President.

...one of them adding:

&gt;Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of , which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit.

Even the right wing Newt Gingrich backs up Gore on this point:

&gt;In all fairness, its something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is  and I worked with him starting in  when I got [to Congress], we were both part of a futures group—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the s began to actually happen.

Ive often got the impression that many women see all the stuff that comes before sex as romance where the emotional connection is established, but sex itself is something else. Whereas men often describe to me how connected sex makes them feel emotionally and that longing for connection might be part of the driving force behind complaints of all you think about is sex. Perhaps what were all thinking about is connection, but we seek it through different things though Im sure theres still some common ground, however many our concepts about what romance is in popular culture are kinda skewed towards what women think it is.

So, no cap has the sense of no lie, no joke, for real, or not bragging. The expression is closely associated with slang in Atlanta-area hip-hop. It appears on Twitter by at least , though it was almost certainly in use in spoken English before then.

He understands what I’m saying, even when I speak in  code. He makes me laugh like no one else in the world. We just get each other. It’s like we live in our own little world. Nobody else exists. When we talk, we skip parts, we don’t need them because we just know what the other is thinking. I wake up and thank God he exists. 

Unfortunately, he doesn’t love me. I used to see love and connection in his eyes, but maybe I was just hopeful and naive. I also went absolutely crazy and had to be hospitalized... I think when that happened, that really scared him off. Like, he was there for me, if I needed him, but it just felt different. 


I think that unrequited love tends to be the most powerful. Just because those feelings of misery and desire can really consume you. You start thinking all that anxiety and longing is normal, and is love. But love is simple. Love is communication. Love is hard work. Love is a choice that you have to make every day.

1333,1333,1333,1352,52,[],,BlackYellowBolas,,,[],,,,text,t2_5yi2gioo,False,False,[],"Been thinking about this topic a lot this year after we hit a huge bump in our relationship. So Ive been reading a lot and watching a bunch of youtube videos. check out Esther Perels Ted talks. 

Things that Ive picked up and are helping us are:

. Find each others Love Languages and actually try implementing them. I enjoy receiving gifts or acts of service from my SO. Not full-blown gifts. Things like picking up coffee when she comes back from her morning shift, or even a nice decoration for our house. Thats what makes me feel loved and thats also how I show love. However! My SO doesnt have the same love language as me. She prefers quality time and words of affirmation. Its tough to remember those things because its not natural for me. My family has never really raised me that way. So, I try to compliment her outfit or the way she looks a lot even though Ive never really been like that before. It used to feel fake, but now its a little more comfortable. 
. Dont lose sight of moments where you can show intimacy. Im trying really hard to find moments where I can show intimacy in spontaneous ways. Is she washing dishes? Hug from behind and nuzzle her neck. Is she watching tv with me? Run my fingers up and down her legs. Leaning in for a kiss? Softly rest your hands on her face to hold the kiss a little longer. These things build closeness and intimacy. They make your partner feel desired and will start to feel comfortable doing the same for you.
. Something I read about scrolling through Reddit is called the Just Do It method. My SO and I had some issues where we both fell out of practice when it came to turning each other on. Both of us were not initiating because we thought the other didnt want it. We would just wait around until they did. It was an infinite feedback loop of not initiating for fear of rejection. We talked and figured this out cough-communication cough. As unsexy as it sounded, we set up a schedule and each of us has a day of the week where we would initiate. I initiate Wednesdays, she on Saturdays. We set a shared reminder on our phone called date night which gives us no excuse. Now when our day comes up, whether we feel the other wants it or not, we Just Do It. We both found out that both of us are usually down. At first, it was weird to have a schedule, but now it makes us feel a bit excited for those days to come around. Bonus points if you couldnt wait long enough for your day to come around. The goal was to eventually not need a schedule, but I think now we both enjoy having our Date Nights because its something to look forward to. 
. I read a bit of the book Come As You Are by Nagoski. The basic thing I took from the book is that I have more spontaneous desire and she has responsive desire. All this means is that I can turn myself on just by looking at a sexy ass piece of fruit and she has to get turned on by an external factor for example, running my hands up and down her, kissing her neck, etc. She will usually not be thinking about sex until sex is actually happening. Im usually thinking about sex...well % of the time. There is nothing wrong with this, as long as desire does happen at some point. Some of us just need certain buttons pushed before getting into that headspace. As much as I would love my partner to be the kind of girl who has sex on her mind as I do, this is not who she is. It took me some time to accept that, and I would get a bit stubborn. I had to realize that this is OK! She is wired very differently than I am.  Theres is no point in being bitter just because she needs me to turn on the engine for her. As long as the engine CAN be turned on, there is nothing wrong with that!
. I cant stress this enough. Passion and intimacy are not about sex... or more like not JUST about sex. Its about closeness. Going up to your partner and groping her boob or touching her crotch is not intimate. It is not gonna have her thinking about sex. Maybe at first, thats all it took, but your relationship has likely said goodbye to the stage where any type of touch means lets go! By needlessly groping your partner, you might be doing more damage and making them feel like thats all they are good for. Just something to be grabbed at. I am extremely guilty of this. I still do it sometimes! But now I try to be aware of the moment and only do it if things are actually in the right environment for it. That means that sexual desire is already built at that moment. You have put her in that headspace. Thats when groping or nasty jokes are received well. NOT when she is making the bed or folding clothes. Stop making her feel like a piece of meat. Next time you catch yourself reaching for a boob, stop, then change the action to a soft intimate action Read # again. As I said, I am still guilty of this but I am trying to stop. I now look at those actions as a little creepy. Dont get me wrong, everyone likes a friendly little squeeze on the butt and maybe a light spank...but just be mindful of what you are doing more of.  Stop and think, How do I want to make them feel right now?

I did not mean to write a whole essay, but as I was typing, it had me reflecting on what has been helping my relationship. Trust me when I say that our relationship hit a major bump. There would be months of no intimacy for other reasons I wont get into now. But communicating with each other is extremely important. If communication is an issue, your relationship is gonna struggle. Im known to be a quiet guy that doesnt reveal a lot. Communicating was not one of my strengths. One day, my SO and I went to a bookstore and found one of those cheesy couples books that just have a ton of questions. Get yourself one of those... Youll realize how much communicating youve been doing. [This isnt the same book but it is similar]

Also tell him orgasms are not the end point of the journey! 

When it gets closer to the deed tell him how communicating during sex makes it better for you both. 

Start to talk about your limits and his, your favorite things and what he wants to try.... But just for general knowledge, not like youre making a to do list. 

Make consent clear: have a safe word and talk about asking him/you if you can do x. Tell him he can always say no and it will not reflect upon his masculinity or how sexy he is. 

Guys seem to relax when you lay it all out and take off pressure....you make sex into less of a performance they have to master and more of an adventure for you both.

As far as the sex .... You could blow him to completion and get him hard again to get a more lasting erection for piv. 

Im not sure Id try anything really exotic or advanced with a virgin whos been holding off for marriage because it might freak him out. But he might be more open minded that that?

I think its nice to tell a man how he turns you on and why hes sexy during the act. You have a lot of insecurities your first time.

My main concerns for virgin men are confidence, nerves, and them fucking it all up by trying to do porn acts. If hes emotionally resilient than you should have fewer issues.

I point this out because it has been pushed against as ghetto or sounding inarticulate or something else. Its not, its a dialect of english and one that has historically been suppressed until its said by a white person or by a mainstream artist. Typical it gets taken by nonpoc and just abused and then it becomes cringy.

.Find out what you dont want, and avoid choices that only lead to these results.

. Keep your options open, the first three points are specific ways, but in general dont dismiss optiins entirely.

. Find YOUR interests and passions.

. Volunteer. This can increase your perspective and network.

. Pursue upgrading your education. At first low commitment/cost in something that preferably interests you, or is marketable.

. Save what money you can. Money isnt everything, but most opportunities arent cheap.

. Self care. Nutrition, exercise and mental health cannot be neglected, even after you know what you want to do.

. Mitigate exposure to toxins. Literally and figuratively. Go easy on recreational drugs, and reduce time with toxic people. I am not saying to give up on other people, but dont become a casualty to their attitude/outlook.

. Realize that to many/most people, organizations and employers, you are a consumable. Take care of your self. Plan for your future.  year,  year  year plans, not set in stone but without any direction, youll be in the same or a worse place in year,  years,  years etc.

Heres a list of somethings you can get into to hopefully get rid of that feeling:

. Start journaling every day. Doesnt have to be a lot, and you could just make it as simple as writing  things you are grateful for every day. 
. Start meditating! You could make it really easy by doing  min a day then gradually ramping up the time. 
. Find a new hobby! Learn how to play an instrument, start a home project, get into card tricks. Something that you have to put focus in and practice.
. Go for a walk every now and then. Try to actually be mindful while doing it. No headphones, cellphone stays in your pocket, listening, and observing all the sounds and sights with no judgment. 
. Try getting off social media. Part of the reason I was feeling like I was just existing was that everyone else looked like they were living. We tend to forget that social media is just a highlight reel of peoples lives and not the real deal. See if you can take a break from FB or Instagram. I still have my accounts, but I deleted the apps. I will occasionally check them when Im on my computer, but thats brought down my social media use by a ton!

As a result, Ive lived in  different countries in the last seven years and welp, massive income difference with my friends. It  also helps that I have a very mercenary-like view of what a job is, to quote one of my clients. I dont mind doing anything remotely related to my field at any given time as long as Im paid accordingly, and thats more than what my friends are willing to do for work. I also secured several streams of income being part-time employed to ensure a minimum and then diversifying by myself  and its honestly a hassle most people wouldnt want to go through.

So I dont have many friends  with whom I can talk about everything, much like your friend. I do have colleagues and neighbours with similar levels of income that can relate to some of my problems, but my friends from high school/college have for the most part either disappeared or turned into groups for very specific interests. I love all of my friends to bits anyways, and I know they appreciate me too, but the decisions weve made along the way have resulted in us being at different stages of our lives in general finance, work, family, projects for the future.... It also has meant that many of my passions and topics I love to discuss are not something they can enjoy talking about, so I mainly stick to how we all are doing in very general terms and our common interests gaming, fucking around, movies, sometimes certain books or comics.

There are some exceptions, though. Some guys genuinely are there for me if I need to talk about anything, and I make sure they know they are appreciated. You can be that for your friend, or you can suggest he finds new friends that are more at his level, for a lack of a better expression. It also would help if he could compartmentalize his relationships somehow and have X group of friends with certain common interests, some other group for some others, and so on.

I broke up with her  months ago cause we were different places in our lives. She wanted to settle down asap and have the life she never had, kids, nice house, loving parents etc. I wanted to move to the big city and try that before I settled down.

We went through couples therapy for the last - months of our relationship, but it didnt save our relationship. It just made it more clear for me, that right now, we were different places in our lives and we had very different ways of looking at what a relationship was suppose to be like.

But I loved her. I would do anything for her and even more. I gave up so much of my own life and identity to be there for her. She was very codependent and I was the only thing in her life, which was very hard to be in the long run.

I had to end it, cause at the current point in time, we werent a great match. But damn I miss her. Her laughter, her smile, her hands, her intelligence. Sadly that package also came with servere insecurity and codependency. I couldnt save her. I know its not my job to save another human, but I tried so bad, but I failed...

But when I broke up with her, she changed. She became malignant, careless and almost sadistic. Not the amazing girl I fell in love with.
It became there personal mission to make me suffer as much as possible. Telling me she had sex with another guy a week after I broke up, telling me about her new conquests etc. Shes a damaged soul and probably best were not together or have any contact.

But damnit I still love her. Even though I was the one who broke up, I still love this girl so insanely much ❤️
Marthina, you probably will never read this, but I love you so much and always will.

And that is if hes feeling compassionate enough. However, we all have vanity issues in some form or another, and if the ordeal put the literal fear of god into him, he will spend his life going from straight relationship to relationship trying to please his dad, eventually get married to a woman out of fear and force himself to live like a straight man when he knows hes lying to himself and forever feel like hes living a lie, and not even dare tell another living soul that hes gay, even possibly well after youve returned to the earth. Or he may figure out one day in middle age that hes tired of living a lie and hurting himself mentally, break it off with whatever woman he happens to be dating or married to at the time, and live the life he felt he was supposed to live and be happy. Or sooner cut ties with you and be rebellious and live his life the way he feels happiest. No one can truly say what will happen, one can only speculate, but, the scarring damage of what you did towards him because of the way he felt happiest will always be with him. It will always be a seething scar in the back of his mind that you dont trust the way he feels, the way he feels happiest, and the life style in which he felt comfortable enough to share with you in the first place because he looked up to you and trusted you.

Im not a super religious individual myself, but, my boyfriend is a man who used to be a brother in the service to god. Ive learned a little more about the bible from him, and secular beliefs despite not being an avid Catholic Baptized and Confirmed, but do not attend services. But first and foremost, if we throw out the Old Testament like we should, for just a moment, can we look at the new and take a few lessons from there?

. Give of ourselves.
. Hate the act of wrongdoing and not the individual.
. Be full of care and comfort when someone needs it most.

But this last one is most important.

. Above all else, your sins in life are forgiven and the gates of Heaven are open to you forever.

I will admit this is an extremely condensed list, but it should do to get the point across. Show him care. Treat him like you would anyone else whom you love dearly and show him compassion and genuine interest in his own love, and realize that the fact that he chooses to love men instead of woman is really not that different than your own love of your wife. Our relationships are not that different from your own. We live, we love, we laugh, we cry, we enjoy, we indulge, and we care. Be willing to show genuine love, and things may turn around and he may be in your life for many years to come, and may very well be there when you need him most just as you were there when he needed you most.

Take your time reading this. Im only , but my life has been fairly dramatic up to this point, including becoming a widower at . Luckily, I had the love, compassion, and care of friends and family around me and I made it through the worst of it.
