Id be sober and then just when things were getting good Id give in and have a drink or a joint or a pill. Its almost like I didnt think I deserved to be clean so Id self sabotage. It sounds funny, but for someone with years of trauma or substance abuse, the idea of being happy and healthy can be scary and different. It felt like a lot of pressure, so on my bad days, Id often relapse. Id convince myself to have just one drink or smoke and every.single.time itd turn into a week-long bender and Id end up back at square one feeling like a piece of crap. Therapy was a huge help, but I understand its not always an option. Ill highlight below though, some of the things my therapist and I remind myself when I feel like Im slipping up:

: Its not a party if its every day. Drugs and alcohol are really fun until they REALLY arent.

: Some people can drink and smoke without repercussions. I am not those people. It was a hard pill to swallow. I desperately wanted to be that person who could have an occasional drink or joint but Im just not and I never will be. A really important technique when Im craving to relapse is to literally stop mid-thought. No reasoning with myself. No what ifs. JUST NO. Its not an option so I dont even think about it. It sucks but thats the way it is

.Happiness and healing is a choice. It takes active involvement. You cant control the things that were done to you in the past but you can decide how you move forward. Every single day I work towards being happy. Some days thats completing everything on my to do list...other days its just not having a drink. You need to give yourself permission to be happy. You deserve to be happy.

.Healing is hard. But so is picking up the pieces of destructive behaviour. In the moment when Im drunk or high, I feel amazing and my best. If you work on healing I promise you can feel that way sober. And it feels a lot more amazing when youre sober too because its really you thats radiating that happiness and confidence...not the destructive behaviour.",,,1609187022,,{},ghbkd8n,False,t3_kl03k6,False,True,t3_kl03k6,/r/AskWomen/comments/kl03k6/what_are_some_ways_to_overcome_selfdestructive/ghbkd8n/,1609188729,1,True,False,AskWomen,t5_2rxrw,,0,[],,2062,385,5.355844155844156,2020,12,28,20,0,0.155,0.651,0.194,NEGATIVE,0.9964264631271362,0

I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD that I inherited from my mom, who has depression. She also has PCOS, which is a risk factor for having children with ADHD and depression. Its a struggle, but Im still glad I was born, and that my parents didnt decide not to have kids because I might inherit mental illness and disorder. Its not as if in a world where only the most genetically robust people reproduce, Id have been born without illness; rather, Id never have been born at all, and other people would have been born instead. I dont think my parents choosing not to have kids so that I wouldnt inherent disorders would really have been a favor to me.

And really, all of my symptoms are treatable with enough work and medical attention, or are able to be easily accomodated by people who are willing to do so. Most of the worst of it comes not from the disorders themselves, but from society making me feel like a burden or acting like I shouldnt exist, and subsequently, me worrying constantly about whether being vocal about my problems is actually contributing to people like me becoming tolerated better, or if its just encouraging people to look for ways to prevent us from existing, because my suffering can be pointed to as an example why its moral to make sure Im not born. The burden of responsibility should really be on society to tolerate us and develop/offer treatment, not be on hopeful parents to not have kids.

Now, all this is not to say that I think its wrong for an individual to choose not to have kids because they dont want their kids to suffer from inheritable illness, because I dont.

I was a sexually active teenager, usually the first to experience young adult things and guided my friends through their experiences. I was very open about my respect and admiration for pornstars growing up, and there was even a time where I was dead set on becoming a director or producer in the adult industry. In my first few years of college, I went through a really rough patch. Dropped out while battling severe depression that was exasperated by anxiety because of dropping out, medicated, became an alcoholic, nearly fucked my life up... and in the midst of it, I decided that I wanted to be an online thot. I sold pics and vids, Skype sessions, etc. Advertised through Twitter and Snapchat. At the time I saw it as a quick way to make money, and it ended up being something I was really good at. I kept it up for around  years, and I was going THROUGH it the entire time. It gave me validation that I couldn’t get anywhere else. My thought process was like: I’m a huge fuck up as far as my family and friends are concerned but at least I’m hot and good at something! And making good money. Talking like... as much as I would have made waiting tables in the city I live in or more. But money and vanity didn’t actually make me happy. It was a false sense of security. As I was healing from my depression and a bad break up, finally back in school and doing well, eating well and exercising, quit drinking, etc., I met my boyfriend. He didn’t ask me to quit what I was doing, but one day a few months maybe even weeks idk into our new relationship, I kind of took a look at everything I had: a different job, back in school with good grades, an abundance of friends, my health, my hobbies and interests, art, a roof over my head, a hot, healthy body with rock hard abs from all that time in the gym, and a boyfriend who loved me no matter what, online thot or not. I realized that I didn’t need the validation anymore. I was GENUINELY happy. And having awesome sex. And I didn’t feel like a lonely fuck up anymore. So I just quit. 

On a side note, I still have MAD respect for all of my favorite pornstars. I think they’re amazing people. I follow them on Insta and buy their merch. I still support the performers but my thoughts on the sex industry are... different now. And another thing that has made me never want to return to amateur porn was when my boyfriend found some of my Snapchat content that had been screen recorded without my knowledge on Pornhub this past year. I know that’s a gamble you take, but I was - and I’m  now. It’s been a few years and it made me feel violated.

She could barely move so it wasnt very scary but you have to commend the will that was there. She also didnt eat much, unless it was something sweet... Then shed eat as much as youd give her. Sweet tooth until her last day:

Another sweet lady came in barely walking and confused. Her back was permanently bent  degree forward and her knees went in all directions with a large scar on one. She couldnt answer anything but very simple questions. But, there was nothing wrong with her decisiveness. She had made it until then by being as strong willed as humanly possible, so she refused any sweet or fatty food - she clearly had held herself slim that way, and being  and in her last years made no difference in her attitude to carbs.

I also became a lot closer to my mom since I had her.. I didn’t always have a good relationship with my mom but now I really appreciate all the hardships she went through just to have me and to raise me. 

The hardest adjustment for me is consistency in our daily routine which I know will become easier over time e.g. sleeping at odd hours, fragmented sleep, not always being able to do things around the house because she doesn’t want to be put down in her bed alone so I have to carry her, lol. Also figuring out why she is fussing or crying. Since she can’t speak and tell us what is bothering her, we constantly have to work through options to make her feel better. 

Other things I would also keep in mind is that it will also raise some conflicts in your relationship with your partner - it’s inevitable. Sometimes both of you are tired and the baby is crying uncontrollably, and it’s very easy to be frustrated with each other. My mom also comes over to help us babysit her often and sometimes we don’t agree with our parenting styles. That causes some strain in our relationship as well. 
It really helps if you have family member that are willing to babysit too. If you have family that can help you out during the day so that you and partner can get some rest especially in the first few months when you are recovering and adjusting to the new life, that would be ideal :

This was the third break up with the same person. I was involved with him for  months casual things; never went beyond making out before he broke things up because we were getting feelings involved and then we got back together almost two months later, to go on to date for the next  months before he broke up again, then we got back together  days later and then dated for  more months after which I broke up. It was my first relationship, and he was my first everything. So it SUCKED, every time we broke up. With the first two break ups, I never thought that we wouldn’t get back together so it wasn’t difficult to get through them but with the last one, I broke down. Completely. We loved each other but we were incompatible in so many ways, I am surprised to think we made it work for as long as we did. But it was emotionally exhausting to be with him, to ask him to fulfill at least some of my expectations. I was stupidly young and naive as well, and he wasn’t - it was his th relationship. After the break up, I cried any time I was alone, didn’t study for the first month or so, wrote to him, tried to get him back. I’m not proud of that one month. He waalo also quite cold and rude towards me after the break up. Two months later I got to know that he had created an account on Tinder and it was like something inside me finally snapped - I woke up. I woke up to the fact that even if loved me, he was actively trying to move on. Why the fuck was I still waiting then?

Later, he tried to get me back twice - each time, due to some soft corner I had for him and my inability to directly say no, I considered getting back with him for around  days before I rejected the idea. I was not ready to go through the same pain and exhaustion only for it to end again in a few months. I was open to being friends but back in September I cut all contact because he would post stories about doing sweet stuff with these new girls he met over Tinder and it really made me feel bad because he didn’t do those things for me. Have been NC for + months now, and it feels great. And I wish I had cut contact the moment we had broke up to be honest; to not see him at all, or to read his texts has helped me immensely.

Drafters make drawing for products that need to be fabricated. Pretty much every tangible thing in the world was created based on drawings of some sort. Said drawings are created a number of ways, the most common way being with drafting software on a computer. 

I absolutely recommend this field, for  reasons:

. Its versatile - since all products need to be designed before theyre created, there are so many ways to apply drafting skills. Almost any company that fabricates something is going to need drafters. Finding jobs to apply for can potentially be easy. Also, lots of companies are moving away from computer towers and more toward laptops. This means you can work from home if needed.

. Its accessible - you can start learning it as early as high school if there is a teacher in your school who teaches it. If you dont get to it in high school, most colleges offer classes in it, even community colleges. Some will even offer summer or night classes geared toward adults who are not able to enroll in college full time but still want to learn. And of course, YouTube will show you anything you want to know.

Its easy - most drafting is done with computers, and computers do all the math for you. You dont need an engineering degree to get a job as a drafter, and the math skills required are basic. Now, depending on where you get hired, you may need to learn some industry specific things, but most of that will be learned on the job. They will hire you if you can prove that you can use the software and are capable of learning whatever you need to.

Bonus reason - if you are a woman in this field, you already have an advantage. Most companies, especially those in the STEM fields, are tripping over themselves to hire women. This includes drafters. You will be entering into a field dominated by men, but dont let that deter you.

 Some companies may actually want you to have an engineering degree in order to be hired as a drafter. It is my personal opinion that this is misguided; unless you are actually designing something, no degree is needed. Any company that does this will have their reasons, but I personally think that they just dont understand what a drafter actually is.

My mom is difficult. There’s a lack of emotional and logical intelligence. She’s very reactive. And makes her decisions off emotions, even when they’re the most illogical. Part of it is cultural Hispanic and the other part is positively due to some childhood trauma. 

I’ve reached a point where I can’t stand my mom. When she speaks, it’s like nails on a chalkboard. She doesn’t make sense half the time. She’s so sure of herself with no evidence. She has no education and lives well below the poverty line despite the fact that she’s lived in the US for thirty years and made nothing of herself. I supplement half her rent because I live here. She counts pennies it’s so embarassing. At this point it’s not survival because despite the opportunities given to you, you don’t take them. It’s stupidity. 

She has narcissistic tendencies. She loves to make you feel bad but repeating herself. She has a terrible habit repeating herself. I love her and would cry my eyes out if her body was  from this earth but I CANNOT stand her as a person. She’s honestly lucky she’s my mom and I have to love her.

I often watch reddit comment on youtube where people tell their secrets and things and i didn t use reddit before. This is my first post. But i have a lot on my mind and i wanted to find a place where i could share how i feel and what i did in hopes of people telling me what to do and if i m a bad person. This is the first thing i found where i could say how i feel so i m gonna write it down here. So a bit about me. My dad has been an alcoholic and a drog addict ever since i know of myself. My mom was an amazing person but she died in a car accident when i was really small. I was always isolated as a kid. I was always home watching cartoons. Other kids in school never liked me. I didn t have many friends. There was one girl that stabbed my back. Thanks to her i downloaded snapchat. Anyway i met someone there. I was . His ended up beeing my first boyfriend. We were together for  months when i had to move to another country where i live today w my alcoholic dad. We didn t do anything sexual. A week before i moved he said that he would wait for me but that he wanted to do it since we wouldnt see each other in a long time. I agreed. And he left me  weeks after i moved. I was geart broken. All of my cartoons never showed sometjing so cruel. I never could have imagined something like that to happen. I went back in my country for sommer break and i met w someone with whom i was talking to for  months. At that point i still wasn t over my ex and i tought that i would set myself free if i did something w the other boy. So i did do that and we ended up beeing together for  weeks in which he would barely talk to me. And he left me a day after i went back to the . Country. It was the first day of school at  am. I went to school and it was a new school year and  boys from my country were in my class now. We eneded up beeing good friends. I finally had someone. A friend. With one of them i talked a lot and after only  months we were together. Everything was perfect. He was so good to me. After  months it was december and i went back to see my familly for christmas.  New years came around qnd i got up w some people from my old class and went to a disco for the first time in my life. I was  years old btw almost . I drank something but didn t get drunk. I only wanted to try it out. It was only one drink. I told my bf who was in the . Country and he couldn t let it go. For  months he was mentally abusing me each day for going out and drinking. In sommer break i went back to se my familly. Those people with whom i went at new years were my friends now. I didn t talk to them much because my bf forbade me. I went for coffee w them and he was very angry and was insolting me for not texting back for an hour when he knew where i was. I was just catching up w my friends. We broke up that day. I was hear broken. I tolerated all of the abuse cause i loved him so much. A couple of days passed and i met someone. He told me how hard his life was and about himself and i found him sweet and charming. We talked a couple of days but didn t really click. Anyway. He wated to do smth. And i let it happen because once again. I tought it would.make my pain go away. I was . At that point and i went back to the . County again. I saw my ex and we went to sit in a park. And he was so nice and kind. I felt happy but i had to tell him what has happend. And he stormed off. I cried and cried. And then he texted me. And eventually we got back together. I did everything that he wanted. I blocked all of my friends. I never left the house. Only for work and school. But then he started to make things up. He was abusive and he would insult me every day for doing what i did w the guy. And he stared to suspect that i was sleeping w people at work. He would insult me every day. I really did change. I realized what i was doing and how fucked up i was. I did everything he wanted and more and as i got better, he got worse. Always mentally abusing me and insulting me. I didn t get to talk to anyone but him. And today it snapped. He told me a lot of things and never to talk to him again because i sent a Merry Christhmas message to a male part of my family and he told me to never talk to him again. That has happend a lot but i know that it s really ove this time. He told me a lot of times that i m a whore and that i have ruined him. That i m a worthles bitch...  I just wanted to ask.

At uni, Ive made friends with an amazing group of women who were all individually very determined in their studies but we never saw each other as competition. We actually made that clear at one point because of another friend group I was in and things got nasty when some people got better grades. We try to support each other as best as we can, even today after many of us have graduated. We proofread each others stuff, send each other academic papers that we come across and think someone in our group might find interesting etc. 

It also helped to reach out to professors etc. IMMEDIATELY if I didnt understand things or was stuck. That way, they saw that I was determined to improve and to get to the core of things, and that actually led to them emailing me interesting articles or even job opportunities. The more your professors know you even if you just go to their office hour to ask for clarifications on their remarks on your essays the more likely it is that they remember you and that a proper relationship forms between you and them. My MA supervisor used to scare the shit out of me when I first met her, but now I trust her very much, and she keeps an eye on me in terms of my mental health. That means so much to me and takes a huge weight off my shoulders. Thanks to her, I was able to get an excellent BA and I hope Ill do great in my MA as well. Perhaps even in a PhD.

Typically breakfast is either skipped or some sort of easy convenience foodthink bagels, oatmeal, cereal etc. Most people are stressed out and rushing through the morning so they dont make time to cook. In my moms house even something as simple as scrambled eggs is considered more of a weekend treat.

Lunch for most people is taken at work or school, so its often a sandwich, leftovers from a previous nights dinner, or some sort of fast food or delivery service. A typical lunch break is only  minutes so that too is a rushed meal.

By the time people get home its often later in the evening many of us have long commutes and people are tired from running around all day, so its a lot of easy, often pre-packaged foods or more fast food/takeout. Pizza, spaghetti with sauce from a jar, canned vegetables and packs of flavored noodles, that kind of thing. As far as I can tell most people have a fairly standard rotation of easy dishes that everyone likes, so theres a lot of carb and sodium bombs, lots of meat, and not a lot of fresh vegetables. Fruit in a meal is also rare, its almost always reserved for a snack if fresh or incorporated in some sort of dessert such as pie.

To be honest, rice and beans are not a staple food, at least in my area. If rice is eaten its usually a tasteless steamer bag cooked in the microwave, or instant rice that you just add hot water to.

I think I wanted to explore my sexuality and get to know myself. I had been with the same guy all through high school and had actually only slept with like  or  people when I got into the industry at age . I started off with nude modeling and fetish modeling and eventually cammed as well. I had an older friend in the industry who connected me with producers and photographers.

Turns out, porn is not empowering and no one cares about the model exploring her sexuality because you have to rub yourself raw and pretend to have fun all for someone elses depraved enjoyment. They try to take advantage of you even just camming. They always try to get more for free. The clients asked me to pretend to do all kinds of awful things, including pretending to be their daughters. One of the fetish sites I worked for was a website catering to people with a fetish for injured, immobile women. How fucked up is that? I didnt think so at the time because I was conditioned to think this is normal and fine. It isnt fine. Fetishes and sexual desires are not created in a vacuum. Porn really is very objectifying. It is anti-woman propaganda. I really hate that those videos are out there forever.

After a year or so, I stopped everything, found radical feminism and some other policital philosophies such as Marxism, and my eyes were opened. If one woman is for sale, we are all for sale. Financially coerced sex acts are still coerced sex acts and if youre against sexual coersion you shouldnt be consuming any porn at all. Its no wonder I felt so awful all the time.

Quitting porn was easy even though I had used it for over  years. I found porn at age  and my sexuality was formed around it and it really fucked me up. Porn really messes with your brain chemistry. When I wanna masturbate now I read erotica.

One for thing, to women reading: it is normal to be repulsed by people who watch porn. Many people will tell you youll be alone forever if you refuse to be with someone who consumes porn. This isnt true and dont let them make you feel bad about it.

I tend to compliment people on their dress if Im really digging what theyre wearing. Be it a stranger on public transit or a co-worker also be it man or woman. But specifically in the context of this post. When I give men compliments on how theyre dressed they are taken aback because from my experiences they say they dont often receive compliments from women outside of close interpersonal relationships with women in their lives. I keep my compliments short &amp; simple with complete strangers because I dont give the compliment with the intention of striking up a conversation or developing anything more than just a nicety in passing. Sometimes though say, with a co-worker, my compliment tends to be more detailed and I might ask a question in order to make conversation. Its also easier for me to do that with someone at my workplace or even someone whom I have only met a couple of times and see once in a blue moon than with a total stranger. 

But I digress, giving a compliment feels good. Just as receiving a compliment feels good. No one is impervious to feeling the way you feel after getting a compliment. Especially if youve gone through some effort to look nice! I definitely pay it forward when someones style catches my eye. From one aesthete to another. 

It does make me sad men dont seem to receive a lot or as much compliments as women do. There are more layers to this phenomenon which I wont bother to delve into here. I also feel like its important to mention that my experiences complimenting men are limited to North America. I wonder how peoples experiences from other continents, countries and cultures differ from my own and by extension - the NA experiences collectively.

I started posting nudes at the end of . I had ended my first relationship at the end of , prior to which I had thought I might have been asexual as I experience arousal, and have known Im into kink since I was maybe , but had never experienced sexual attraction to another human and therefore never got sexually frustrated. End of , I had decided not to stay involved with a man I had been casually involved with from the start of  to the end as he couldnt commit to monogamy. I had no idea what to do with sexual frustration, so decided nudes were a way to go, and meant I could explore kink and involve other people without having to be physically involved. 

So I started posted nudes on Reddit, made and deleted about four accounts as I would get addicted to the attention and needed a break. 

Made an onlyfans around May at the suggestion of my flatmate, who knew I posted nudes she also provided emotional support throughout. I made a Snapchat a month or so later, since deleted, and it was pretty awful. I interact the bare minimum amount with people now. Men by and large seemed to be think they were entitled to my body. So many would harass me for free nudes/say they looked down on buying them like harassing me was better. Others didnt understand why I wouldnt trust them with my personal info, i.e. name, face, where I live. There have genuinely been moments where Ive thought - this man is going to murder me and I will be found cut up into small pieces. 

I found it mostly dehumanising because youd have a great conversation with someone but you knew they were there for the nudes and were never quite sure if they saw you as a person or not, and very few ultimately treated me like I was a person. 

To be perfectly arrogant, Im well educated, did a STEM degree through a programme that let me shave a year off the normal time, and have consistently achieved in the top % of my year. Men were constantly surprised I knew things and made condescending comments/treated me like I was an idiot. 

Overall I feel like its made it hard to trust men, or feel like they see me as a person.

These type of people are already stepping over a line by even contacting someone who works in any kind of sex industry. 
Psychological if you push your own boundaries in any shape or form, its easier to do another step. And that way you will one day find yourself at a completely different place than you were at the beginning. 

Not all men are at this place.

Take me for example, I am single guy, father to a  year old. The thought of contacting anyone for any sexual favour, even in the shape of FWB sounds insane to me. It has to be a love interest. 
I hate the hookup culture, I hate men who prey on women in any way and I have hated my own gender because of stories I have heard of how men treats women. Even their own wives, wtf? Maybe I stil do.

The other day my ex got wasted and I helped her puke, helped her to bed and stayed until I knew she was alright. And this girl cheated on me. I didnt do it because Im a pushover, I will let you know if I want you to fck off. I did it because I feel the need to make sure people are okay. She included. 

So this type of behaviour where you make anyone feel like they have been used is a crime to my very being.

It can fuck you up emotionally if done cared for, if that makes sense; like you feel completely empty and dead, as I have felt before in my shittiest moment with a guy that was using  me for sex.

I have personal experience throughout my adult life with men of my own racial group black disparaging black women. Once to my face, towards me. I was righteously yelling at a man that groped me. And a black man came to the pervert’s defense and proceeded to yell at me and said this is why I don’t date black women they’re loud + ratchet.

The other times I’ve witnessed this behavior have been different. Usually, random black men disparage black women around me because I am lighter skinned and in my current city I’m not often perceived as black or they assume that I’m okay with colorism. While I do acknowledge that I benefit from that privilege, I don’t think well of black men that disrespect black women because it’s entirely hypocritical. Sexism is one thing because when a man partakes in it it’s not against himself if that makes sense. But internalized racism makes no sense and it’s pretty tragic. Most people outside of the black community don’t recognize the scope of the issue. Like in my  years on this planet I’ve never dated a black man. The door of opportunity is still open but I’ve yet to meet someone that doesn’t have that hate within themselves.

I have anxiety and depression, and have had multiple sexual trauma experiences - so I already didnt trust people. I got to know a few people that were also photographers, and got involved with a couple who both did photography- one a boudoir photographer, the other varied. This was my first time being photographed with a purpose one mind - as to friends getting pics of me during a scene at some party. One day I met them at their studio/event space to shoot some of my own content and then help with lighting on something else - I wanted to learn more about photography and he didnt mind me helping. Well... they drugged me. Woke up the next day in my apartment with a vague memory of leaving the studio with them after taking a tylenol which they gave me, a hotel lobby, lights through a car window, and my hallway stairs. I woke up with bruises and clear signs of what happened. I later found out from someone weeks later that they had seen me at an orgy filming - being hosted and filmed by them - and was uhhhh under the impression that everything was co consensual and I was under their protection. Whatever I shot with him when I was sober was supposed to remain private and at my discretion, nevermind all the nonconsensual stuff. But without my consent they posted it all on hamster - my face one of the main focuses. I didnt find this part out until I started seeing gifs of the consensual stuff on IG or tumblr. Then I saw some pics and gifs of the stuff that happened was I was drugged... I entirely cut myself from the bdsm scene and cut off everyone, even friends. I was horrified. Despite everything Ive gone through, including childhood molestation over prolonged periods and more violent encounters... this experience has effected me in an entirely different way. NOT remembering beyond flashes has effected me in a way that full-on memories have not. I know over decades Ive probably just grown more prepared for bad memories. But the lack of memory... I have yet to figure out how to deal with it. 

This happened  years ago, and Ive been agoraphobic since. Ive always had bad social anxiety, but it is very bad now. I talk to no one and never leave my apartment except maybe to the deli a block away - I get everything delivered. Since covid, I cant even try to force myself to sit inside a safe place one a month - which is really just the local coffee shop. My life is entirely over really. Zero family, zero friends, a prisoner to myself in my apartment. 

Sooo I guess Im just a warning story. This was a committed couple prominent and well-known in the local bdsm community, established photographers, vetted by people I trusted. Abusers do not abuse everyone they know! Never do anything based on vetting alone. Always have someone you trust that they dont know accompany you - as well as tell  people where you will be located between what times, and if they dont hear from you or get a response by X time please look for you. Never take a single thing from them - sealed drinks you open yourself, or drinks that only you and the bartender have touched that you keep in your hand and dont put down on any bar or table. I didnt peruse any action against this person because  shame and  after my experience I talked to another girl who tried taking him to court for an assault and nothing stuck I had even less evidence or anything than she did. But I dont have a track record of holding my abusers to any legal repercussions... I would really urge anyone else with any similar experience to speak up asap.

The houses smell, because at a certain point you simply cant keep up at a pace needed to keep pets and a clean home. Many dont realize that you need to be shampooing your carpets and cloth furniture at least quarterly to ensure there isnt severe dander build up, which bad for both you and your pets respiratory system.

The people Ive known with a lot of pets can never afford the vet bills or ongoing care. An unpopular opinion, but pet ownership is a privilege, not a right. If you cant afford a $k vet bill tomorrow, you cant afford your pet. If you financially cant or refuse to provide the lifestyle needed for your pet, you cant afford a pet.

Long haired dogs need regular grooming and haircuts, those mats you leave them with hurt. All dogs need daily exercise, you need to be able to devote at least an hour a day to ensuring your dog gets plenty of exercise. No, just letting them out into the backyard by themselves doesnt count. If youre a vegan who refuses to purchase animal products, dogs and especially cats simply arent the right animal for your lifestyle. If you cant give your hamster at least  sq ft of floor space in their cage in your home, you cant afford a hamster.

My ex-friends would buy pets like other people would buy plants, but then refuse to alter their lifestyle to ensure the pets needs were met. Theyd leave their dogs locked in the car to go drinking all night rather than leaving them at home. Theyd have money to buy $ of supplies for their hobby monthly, but theyd put their cat down for a broken leg and infection because they couldnt afford the cost needed to have the animal properly receive treatment. They could never afford a dog sitter for when they took a vacation, so theyd just keep the dog locked in their home and deal with the shit and piss when they got back.

People with a lot of pets also use their volume of pets as an indicator of the quality of care they provide. One girl I knew in college had  cats, but not a single cat tree or vertical space the cats were allowed on or toys to play with. If you do any research on cat care, youd know this is a horrible situation to put any one cat in, let alone . They were never able to escape each other and were constantly fighting and drawing blood.

When I told her I was engaged to my long term same-sex partner, she freaked out and cried like Id told her I had died while simultaneously complaining that I would not wear a dress to the wedding. She later claimed to have been happy when I told her.

She insisted for years that marriage is between a man and a woman while I begged her to think otherwise. When I finally got married, she did help me pay for the wedding, but she refused to ever say that she felt same-sex marriage should be legal. 

She never listens to me or accepts my perspective on anything if it is different than hers. I recently had a discussion with her where I talked a bit about my feelings when I was growing up and how part of why I liked Star Wars was because I thought Leia was pretty. She freaked out and accused me of saying that girls cant like scifi without being a lesbian. My mom likes scifi and I supposed construed my passing comment as a dig on her because she clearly still thinks being a lesbian is a bad thing. 

I focused a lot on the gay part of my identity here, but this attitude of hers extends into basically everything. Im not sure if shes more upset that Im gay, liberal, believe in climate change , or am an atheist.

I left being a dom behind after I went to rehab. Then I moved to a new city and I now work as the manager of a coffee shop.

I got started because I have daddy issues. I know it sounds cliche, but it is the case. Between my dad choosing another woman/family over me and my mom, and not being popular in school, I found a place where I held all the power and attention. Men wanted me and even paid me money to see me. It made me feel wanted. It made me feel loved in a weird way. 

I was making tonnes of cash to pay for University and bought a house. It was good until the recession started to kill the industry. I made lots of good money with high-end regulars because I had a good personality and like to talk. So they would fly me to places for meetings with business clients. They knew I could hold it together in front of clients because I wasn’t heavy into drugs. I never slept with anyone. So they liked that they weren’t going to be extorted for way more money then they wanted to spend. 

The best part is when I would run into people from high school my Uni was only two hrs from where I went to HS. It was a powerful moment for me. I liked to rub it in their face that I was this beautiful sexual being that they couldn’t have. I liked to see them regret being mean to me. 

Yes as you can see, I have/had issues. I got out because the life wasn’t sustainable anymore. Like I said, the recession killed the industry. High-end clients had less side cash. People in general had less spending money. The only girls who could make money were ones willing to do extras, and that was never my cup of tea. I wanted to have a child with my husband, and you can’t strip when you’re pregnant well.... you can, I just didn’t want to. 

After I had my son, I tried to go back because I couldn’t find a regular job. I still looked good, but I didn’t feel the same. Whenever someone tried to touch me it wasn’t a fun oh haha, that’s not allowed. It gave me anxiety and fear. I lost all sexuality and confidence. I would never let anyone see my baked body again. 

I wish I could go back to pole dancing and do the tricks. I used to do ballet growing up, and I wish I could just perform tricks without taking my clothes off. The athleticism it takes is what I miss most. I’m in therapy now, and I can see why the job had its appeal to my younger self.

Red flag for the relationship being a problem.....I would say any insecurities, trust, or weird behaviour of your partner where you feel disrespected or not considered......really get to the bottom of it. Like before we always fought over money even though it was an emergency like filling in a little gas in your tank so your car doesn’t break down.  Like little things like that. Because having a house it requires you to dish out money small or big in an instant if it’s an emergency repair, etc. You guys can’t get upset for having to dip in your emergency fund. 

Trust your gut feeling. I know it’s superficial to say but I had that weird gut feeling of this ain’t right for a long time and when I have the free time which is everyday since I work from home, I kept being reminded why this situation doesn’t feel right and I felt suffocated. 

There’s a lot and it does vary case by case. But I never had that trust and comfort of my fiancé. So yeah. But I learned my lesson and I know better for when this comes along again in my life. Good luck ladies!!!!

I dont know what I processed when because it all hit me like a fucking wrecking ball sorry for the Miley Cyrus reference but for real.

My mom was at fault for the reasoning but it had been building up for years. We expected our parents to divorce when we were kids but my moms actions catapulted it to the separation about  years ago. Its just been civil with them for awhile. But this year I believe was the last Christmas my mom would stay at our childhood home, separate room of course, with my dad. She just cant do it anymore. This was another odd year with everything else going on because of that as well. We had to adjust to them separating, her living  hours away with none of us around her, pursuing a career that her affair kind of jolted her into, which is a constant reminder for me, and, Im not sure how I deal with it. I just do because I have to.

My dad did vent to me a lot in the beginning because my mom had an affair; she lied to us all, and, he wanted us to know the truth, but details he shared...a father shouldnt be sharing with his daughter, and he apologized for it later but I understood he had nobody to talk to.

For being poached, the people work the same way any abusers do. They look for vulnerable, attractive, and unlikely to decline their requests. The sort of people who struggle to say ‘no’, and typically have experienced abuse. 

For the second group, try to think about who seeks out being in porn. It’s either people who don’t love themselves and already feel useless outside of their sex appeal or talent, normally from abusive backgrounds that make them comfortable with forcing themselves to have sex with a smile on their face, or the people who love sex and are genuinely happy working in the industry. They exist too, but in my experience are a lot more rare. 

Personally, I’ve met more trafficked women and more underage women being  groomed by big names in porn than the people who are genuinely happy to do it.

It was our thought that when our children became adults, they would choose one part or another as their last name and maybe use the other as their middle name.

Before onlyfans was a thing I used to have a NSFW snapchat that was $/month as well as post on Reddit to low-key advertise. Its not this account so if you browse my history youll just see my depression lol.

 I also ran a discord server where I had over  fans. It was mostly to just repost my free content and provide some interaction and I was much more talkative with my buyers. However every once in a while Id do a free cam session where I try on clothes or just show off a sexy new outfit. 

I was making upwards to $ extra a month which was fun money  however it was a full time job and it was exhausting. 

First, I am expected to post upwards to - times a day on snapchat weather its just sexy teases or using sex toys and idk it gets annoying to masturbate every day so I got really good at fake moaning. 

Second, people hate paying for shit so there will be people shit talking you. Others are on the fence and try waste your time asking for some free stuff to see if its worth. And other dudes just beg and beg for free things. It can be exhausting dealing with these guys.

Third, the guys who do pay for your stuff can vary between people who are content and others who think you owe them more than what youre giving. Some think theyre entitled to my attention whenever they message me and some expect a close friendship or even relationship and its hard to be firm because you can get manipulated even if youre prepared. I had one guy who was a bit of a sugar daddy, he would send me big chunks of money from time to time and would guilt me into talking to him more guess the $ I sent wasnt enough and Im like hey! Man, I like to keep things personal but Im at WORK  but he would still try guilt me.

Fourth thing, you constantly need to be getting new toys or outfits to keep things fresh because I actually have had people complain Ive worn the same lingerie before 

All in all its a lot of work which can be exhausting. 

I left because I had made enough money and I was just tired of people feeling entitled to me. Plus a few got really creepy and tried to find out where I live  and ect, thats always no fun

Here’s an excerpt of one his books in which he talks about vulnerability. Stuck with me:

Vulnerability is not a weakness, a passing indisposition, or something we can arrange to do without, vulnerability is not a choice, vulnerability is the underlying, ever present and abiding undercurrent of our natural state. To run from vulnerability is to run from the essence of our nature, the attempt to be invulnerable is the vain attempt to become something we are not and most especially, to close off our understanding of the grief of others. More seriously, in refusing our vulnerability we refuse the help needed at every turn of our existence and immobilize the essential, tidal and conversational foundations of our identity.

To have a temporary, isolated sense of power over all events and circumstances, is a lovely illusionary privilege and perhaps the prime and most beautifully constructed conceit of being human and especially of being youthfully human, but it is a privilege that must be surrendered with that same youth, with ill health, with accident, with the loss of loved ones who do not share our untouchable powers; powers eventually and most emphatically given up, as we approach our last breath.

The only choice we have as we mature is how we inhabit our vulnerability, how we become larger and more courageous and more compassionate through our intimacy with disappearance, our choice is to inhabit vulnerability as generous citizens of loss, robustly and fully, or conversely, as misers and complainers, reluctant and fearful, always at the gates of existence, but never bravely and completely attempting to enter, never wanting to risk ourselves, never walking fully through the door.",,,1609109187,,{},gh89ybs,False,t3_kl2q5p,False,True,t1_gh6uzo9,/r/AskWomen/comments/kl2q5p/what_are_some_good_apps_for_journalingpracticing/gh89ybs/,1609111465,1,True,False,AskWomen,t5_2rxrw,,0,[],,1765,283,6.236749116607774,2020,12,27,22,0,0.17,0.701,0.129,POSITIVE,0.9725440144538879,1
