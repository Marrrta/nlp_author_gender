During the last 2 weeks I have been trying to contact this nurse: First I called home base to ask for his telephone number and when I should begin my shift with this nurse, because nobody told me. Then, during this 2 weeks I called and texted this nurse and he never replied. Not.a.single.time.

The secretary on home base told me boss would be unavailable until the 24th, so it wouldn't make any sense to call her before that day, which I did not.

On the 24th I called her, phone number unavailable.

I called the nurse. Phone unavailable.

Saturday and Sunday, I call both numbers, nobody answers, nobody calls either.

Sunday was a day off, meaning I don't check email. On this day, boss sent me an email (didn't call or sent a message to my smartphone, just an email). informing that to further work I need a negative covid test. I only read that E-Mail in the evening, too late to do the testing, meaning I lost a working day.

I sent an answer immediately stating that I have been calling them so they tell me when I have to go to work, protesting why they write emails instead of calling and that I'm sorry, but I cannot work like this.

Her answer: it is my responsibility to arrange a meeting with them to do the testing and she was always available during Christmas.

What I want to answer: 'I only know I have been calling you during last week and your phone number was unavailable. You treat me like I don't want to work there. I'd like to have a chat with you to clear the air. I like working with you and your team, but I don't want the workplace to become toxic and I neither want to walk on eggshells around you'

A bit too direct you may think. If you want to reformulate, please do.

But that is for me the truth: I enjoy working there, I have learned from my coworkers, it is an easy job, patients are nice, coworkers are mostly nice. I see myself working here full time. But at the same time I don't want to have to walk on eggshells around my boss or any other coworker fwiw.

But he had commitment issues and was never willing to give it the label that I needed. We were exclusive, and did things a couple would do, just never put the label on it. Eventually, about four months ago, I decided I needed more and asked him for a label, he wouldn't do it, so I told him we needed to break up.

However, we operate in the same circle, have a lot of the same friends and it's completely unavoidable to not run in to each other so we agreed to stay friends. We were doing really well with the friends thing until this weekend when we both got drunk and hooked up. We spent the next day together watching tv and acted like everything was back to how it was when we were together. But I haven't heard anything from him today.

My anxiety is getting the better of me and I'm a mess. I missed him so much and I want him back. I honestly have wanted him back pretty much since we broke up. But I don't know what to do from here. I know I'm going to see him in our shared locations and I don't know how I should act. Should I text him? Should we talk about it? Should I act like nothing happened?

We were doing really well with the friends thing until this weekend when we both got drunk and hooked up.

Alright, I dont know the rules of this sub, but the people in this sub seem to be the most level headed/realistic people in reddit so i choose this sub for help instead of the relationship one

Okay, im a 17 year old kid, I have a girlfriend whom I care about and adore, notice how I said care instead of love, we've been dating for 1 year and while I was attracted to her when I initially meet her its just not there anymore, dont get me wrong shes pretty and she dances competitively so she has an amazing body, and oh boy she likes me alot, but ever since i met this other girl a few months ago my love for my girlfriend has just been dwindling down hard, Our personalities just click together, we have deep conversations for hours and hours together and it does not take a genius to tell she loves me too, plus she threw a number of hints that she likes me which gave me the courage to confess my feelings,i told her i love her and lo and behold she feels the same, keep in mind she knows that i have a gf but neither new girl or me mentioned her in the confession conversation we had, and i just like this new girl more, she has a prettier face, big full lips and really big brown eyes(i glowed up hard when i was 15 and got no attention from girls before that age so im still surprised that i got her attention), she gives me butterflies when ever i see her,

most of you reading this would tell me to just break up with my current girl, but like I said before I dont know how to tell her this, she knows i hang out with new girl alot and she told me that it makes her insecure, i assured her id never cheat(which i never did) i just dont know how to do this?? do i just stay because i dont want to break her heart or break up and date the other girl? Thinking of her doing this to me with another guy break my heart but I just dont love her anymore.

There was this girl, lets call her Emily, that I had some brief conversations with. Just friendly banter, nothing more to my naïve eyes. She was also 8 years older than me so I thought she was way out my league (she was hot, but I digress). Anyways, as I'm collecting my stuff to leave, I say bye to my coworkers in the break room and start heading for the stairs. Mind you the stairs are hella narrow, like only one person can fit at a time. When I reach the doorway to the stairs, that's when Emily and I collide. She has glasses so I tease her a bit for being blind and not paying attention  and she comes back at me, letting me know that I don't have to take the kitchen sink with me when I leave the house (I was carrying a lot of crap from my locker since it was my last day).

A year ago I met this girl at my new work, I made the mistake of putting her on a pedestal and over fantasizing about her, when I found out she had a boyfriend it really hurt but after sometime I wasn't doing so bad, I'm actually in probably the best shape of my life, lost a lot of weight this year.

Anyway the issue came a month ago she randomly texted me on a sunday for help with something, I wasn't the only one she texted she also texted a female friend of mine for help, it was still a little weird because we were not even close to being friends but yeah, after that she started to text me and sending audios almost everyday mostly about work but also some shit about anime you know just normal stuff, it was kind of weird because she sends a lot of audios really late at night at 1:00 - 3:00 A.m and some of them were very random not really important, of course I'm stupid so I started to think that maybe she is interested me and well she was the girl I fell for in the first place, anyway to not make it too long it's very obvious she likes to talk to me but that's probably it, but seeing her whatsapp statuses and whatsapp profile pictures it seems she is happy with her boyfriend and loves him, I just want some advise on how to handle that, she will probably keep texting me most days and she sees my statuses and I see hers, should I just stop randomly seeing her statuses? I'm still going to reply to her of course I don't want to be a dick, but if she asks me why I stopped that what should I tell her? honestly I just wished she stopped texting me at all, it was better that way, I wish I could tell her that but then she is going to ask why, I wish I could tell her the reason but obviously its going to be awkward because we are in the same team, I'm going to try to avoid looking her at work and in general not talk to her but can you people give me some advise? Thank you

TLDR: Fell for a coworker, she started to talk to me, mistook signs and now I'm more hurt than before.

Also do you feel a therapist or psychologist can truly help me with this? I know this is not true love but It really hurts and is draining too much energy from me and this is hurting me really bad.

Now this is a place I've been to before but it was fairly recessed into my memory, a story for another time, and I was desperately trying to recall which friend of her's this was. ""Bring casual clothes for before the party and a nice shirt for dinner"" Okay, I set off and I reach the house before my cousin, there are 4 cars parked, despite my cousin's friend, heretofore referred to as Aunt Jemima, being home alone. 

 Now this house was of no small size, yet the level of hoarding employed by Aunt Jemima was to an absurdist degree, upon entry to the house you could see three christmas trees, one fake(and worth $1000 apparently) and two real, with one of the real trees being 3 years old and somehow still speckled green. Now despite being advised to dress nice, Aunt Jemima ushered me in while wearing  printed tights under a short santa skirt, a red graphic tee and a santa hat with a bottle opener at the end. I was immediately put to work cooking while Jemima set up three different ring light tripods and forced me to go on facebook live, to sate her i simply had my phone recording video that I could later delete. All the while she was yelling, something something ""fucked up house but its okay because its not a normal day"" and so such and the other. She asked me if I was live like 50 times too. I chose to remain as quite as possible while she narrated everything I did out loud for her 1 viewer on facebook live.

Luckily my cousin arrives, and she asks me if I was okay because she knows Jemima can be intense, my cousin brought her boyfriend(M, ?? years old) whom I could somewhat relate to, little did I know this was the extent of the guest list. None of Jemima's 3 kids wanted to come, none of her other friends, and none of the apparently 50 people she nows around the neighborhood. My flight response activates and remains on for the rest of the night, whenever Jemima wasn't preoccupied with my cousin I'd escape to the backyard to see what her boyfriend was up to on the grill, he was also forced to cook, I was in the kitchen preparing a whole chicken and a chunk of beef, while he was cooking 60% of a pig. As I drove I didn't want to drink, as the one sober one, my cousin and Jemima forced me to usher her to the liqour store to which she is a regular, she bought 200 dollars worth of alcohol, I had to carry all of it because I'm ""a young military man who should be able to handle it."" about 200 more words were said than that but at this point i couldnt be arsed to percieve every second of Jemima's speech patterns.

I've failed to mention that at any given point of time there were three active sources of music being played, the patio radio, the alexa placed next to the triumvirate of ring lights and the christmas tree with electronic ornaments. So after another hour or so of yelling, linkin park and christmas reggae, Jemima's husband, uhhh, Barbados Slim arrives. A man who is NOT the man she is depicted with in all of the household photography, the man in her photos is her current fiancee but I digress. Immediately things get a magnitude more dicey, he introduces himself to me and the other two guests, when Jemima arrives tailing him, she starts yelling at him for some reason, and she walks up to me and tells me to go up to him and introduce myself as Joseph. Not my name. Her son's name as I'd later learn. I glanced at my cousin, eyeing to her what I should do and she shrugged. So out of fear I did it and Barbados Slim laughs and looks at me and back at his wife ""She told you to do that right? A wha' do her""(patwa for ""What's wrong with that woman"") 

I hardly myself understood why Jemima wanted me to do this, she couldnt remember my name, nor my familial relationship to my cousin. one argument later, Jemima yells at Slim ""It's for a instagram! Everything's a instagram\[sic\]"" And she forces me to reenter the kitchen and continue her facebook live stream, she dissapears again and the next time i exit the kitchen and Barbados slim is holding his christmas present, purchased by my cousin, in two peices, in the time I was gone Jemima both split the present in half and threw a bunch of shit on the floor. At this point I am now biding my time until I hear the words ""You can leave"" I laboriously reorient the night into a stealth mission, and as the night comes to a close, I remember that I dropped some of the beef on the floor and I speed out of that place like a bolt of lightning.

Ill start, IM, yes this is relevant didnt have any plans for Christmas so my cousinF invited me to a Christmas party at her friendF~s house. Now this is a place Ive been to before but it was fairly recessed into my memory, a story for another time, and I was desperately trying to recall which friend of hers this was. Bring casual clothes for before the party and a nice shirt for dinner Okay, I set off and I reach the house before my cousin, there are  cars parked, despite my cousins friend, heretofore referred to as Aunt Jemima, being home alone. 

 Now this house was of no small size, yet the level of hoarding employed by Aunt Jemima was to an absurdist degree, upon entry to the house you could see three christmas trees, one fakeand worth $ apparently and two real, with one of the real trees being  years old and somehow still speckled green. Now despite being advised to dress nice, Aunt Jemima ushered me in while wearing  printed tights under a short santa skirt, a red graphic tee and a santa hat with a bottle opener at the end. I was immediately put to work cooking while Jemima set up three different ring light tripods and forced me to go on facebook live, to sate her i simply had my phone recording video that I could later delete. All the while she was yelling, something something fucked up house but its okay because its not a normal day and so such and the other. She asked me if I was live like  times too. I chose to remain as quite as possible while she narrated everything I did out loud for her  viewer on facebook live.

When I was driving my half-siblings to our grandmother's house on Christmas, my brother (8th grade) was talking about this girl who was starting to get creepy with him. According to him, she constantly texts him and won't leave him alone. If I remember correctly, she sent him 50 texts in one night after he told her to cut it out. What really got me concerned was when he told me that she walked by their house and shot him a message saying ""I like your Christmas lights"". After confirming that he knows better than to try to get with her, I told him that he needs to at least tell our mother about the situation because it sounded like it was getting serious. He hand-waved it away saying that ""it wasn't a big deal"" and that he was kind of amused by her crazy texts.

 I respect  that he'd rather handle the situation on his own and I don't want to overstep boundaries. However, I've heard too many stories about guys not taking girl stalkers seriously and having it bite them in the balls later on. This isn't the craziest behavior I've heard of but I think it needs to be nipped in the bud asap. I really think he needs to at least tell one of his parents just so they know about the situation.

Some of you have been asking for an update, so I came back to give you one!

Since my original post, my friend and I have been seeing each other a lot more frequently and our friendship has been deepened quite a lot. We spend a lot of one-on-one time together, in fact we _only_ hang out one-on-one, just the two of us. During this time we have cuddled, shared some quite _emotionally_ intimate moments and have discovered a mutual _sexual_ attraction between us. We also have a lot of plans for fun things we want to do together in the future. The idea of forming a FWB relationship has been put out there and discussed, but I'm still undecided on whether I want to do that or not. 

Over the last few weeks we have had a few conversations about relationships in general, and got to know what the other person would want from a relationship. He has repeatedly stated that he is really not ready for a committed romantic relationship right now, and he has his own perfectly valid reasons for that, so I respected that and decided not to say anything about my feelings for him.

However, there has been a gradual shift in the relationship dynamic between us. He has been saying increasingly sweet - even romantic - things, and just recently he said to me that he is ""the luckiest guy is the universe"" for having me in his life. I was quite shocked by this, as it's really not something you say to someone who you see as ""just a friend""! He also can't seem to get enough of my company - literally any excuse he can find to hang out with me, he will not hesitate to snap up the chance. 

He is _already_ behaving like a boyfriend in some ways, and I'm patient enough to be happy to continue the friendship in this way for now. He has been hurt, even heartbroken in the past and is probably scared of his own feelings for me and what a relationship would mean for him, so I am going to continue to approach this with caution and let him come to me on his own. I am mirroring everything he does and says - if he says he feels lucky to know me, I say it back. If he says he appreciates me, I say I appreciate him too. If he invites me to cuddle, I reciprocate. I think he needs this to progress at a pace he is comfortable with. And of course, if he wants to stop at any time, that's fine too.

I don’t mean sexually inexperienced men, but men who haven’t really been appreciated by previous partners.

He promised me he would pace himself. Long story short: He threw up everywhere and in front of everyone. Next day he acted as nothing happened.  After years of trying to get him to recognise he needed help, I had enough- I cut him off completely. I didn't need that energy around me.

Basically, my brother is 40, his best friend is 38; we’ll call the best friend “Tom” from here on. They have been friends for about 20 years now, and I first met Tom back when I was 11 (he would come over to play video games with my brother). As the years progressed, we didn’t see each other much because my brother and I would always do our separate things. I left to college eventually, did my own thing and then moved back to my hometown when I was 21. That’s when my brother and I started getting really close and I would hangout with him and his friends every once in a while. Overtime, I got to know each of his friends to a certain extent; we would all joke around with each other and would get along really well. 
That’s when I developed a crush on Tom, but I never pursued anything because I just didn’t imagine he would feel the same way; given the 12-year age gap and the fact that I was his best friend’s sister. 

Fast-forward some years and I am now 26. The last time Tom and I saw each other was 2 years ago and we haven’t spoken since. Then, this year, about a month ago, he randomly added me on Instagram. As soon as I realized who he was, I added him back and messaged him to see how he’d been. That led to us messaging each other non stop, eventually talking on the phone, then actually meeting up in person. The connection was almost instant, and although we both met up just to hangout as friends, things took a turn and we ended up as more than friends. We’ve been seeing each other for about 2 months now; having movie nights, going on dates, talking everyday, hanging out in person 2-3 times per week, etc. 
Early on, we agreed that we would keep things secret, just to avoid any potential drama with my brother.

Now, things are slowly starting to get more serious - I.e. agreed we wouldn’t see other people, have deep emotional talks, call each other every day, and the list goes on. Basically, it seems that we’re starting to develop feelings for each other, and I’m starting to think that we may end up having to tell my brother about us (If things continue getting serious). That makes me worried because idk how my brother would react. Like if he would be mad at both of us or if he would completely cut ties with his friend or if he would be disappointed in me...

Tom says that he thinks my brother would not be mad and instead would be happy that Tom is staying within the family. I disagree and feel like my brother would not approve, mainly because of the age gap and the amount of years that they’ve known each other.

Overall though, Tom and I are both adults, so I’m going to do whatever makes me happy. He treats me with respect, makes me feel safe, and I’m happy when I’m with him.
I just do worry about how things will potentially blow-over if/when we tell my brother.

I find it extremely interesting talking to him, not only is he extremely intelligent but he always offers a new point of view and also seems genuinely interesting in my point of view. I come from a pretty religious family, we never talk about Sex, love etc. But I am not as stuck up about these topics like my parents. He is really open minded about this stuff, so when the topic arises, we have also discusions about that. He is married and has a son. 

A couple months ago he got posted to one of our branches abroad. He was really excited that he could do it, due to the pandemic the posting was almost postponed. He got moved to a country I am very interested in, and I was very happy for him that he got the job. On his last day I visited him in his office to say goodbye bc it'll probably be the last time I'll see him physically for a few years. So we hugged (we were just covid tested, we get tested regularly at our workplace) and he hugged me really tightly while he kissed me on my ear/ cheek. I found that a bit strange, but I didn't think too much about it.

We keep in touch, and usually text at night ( I guess we're both night owls) again, I still enjoy talking to him a lot, but the asked me / told me some things that make me wonder how he sees me:

- told me he noticed immediately that I'm pretty girl but it's a pity I dress so conservativly (true, I usually wear black and very little to no make up, I really like long skirts and vintage sweaters) 

- we talked about the enlightment Era and the sexual liberation that followed and he asked me if I ever tried sadism  or like being dominated (to which I said no and he said he already expected that) 

- told me one night he wished I was there with him. When I asked if he meant working with him at the branch he said no.  I was too afraid to ask what he meant 

- tells me a lot of compliments about how he thinks I'm intelligent, nice and hard working and should stay the way I am

- asked me if I have a boyfriend 

- when I said no, he said he believed I would make someone really happy if I ever got engaged 

 he also said once that he heard that being in a monogamous relationship is like eating the same meal everyday. When I asked him if this applies to his marriage too, he said it's true to a certain extent

I might read too much in this, but sometimes I think about his wife. I guess I wouldnt like it if my husband talked at night with his younger female coworker about things like this.

I am a 27 year old Tanzanian lady... He is a 48 year old German gentleman. It started out pretty casual between us. Sex, then he drops me off at my apartment, might buy me a gift or two on the way there, might not, might call me later on to say goodnight, might not. More sex...going out to eat or dance in the city, sex and then he drops me to my place...might call, might not. None of us really had a problem with this casual arrangement. It was simple &amp; nice. No complications. I liked him, he liked me. It's been 9 months of knowing one another. 

We were both single (fresh out of abusive relationships and so thought to ourselves to keep it casual between us &amp; see where it goes without forcing anything) 

Ofcourse the obvious cultural clashes in the beginning like any interracial couple experiences but we learnt to navigate our way through our differences and find a way around such natural culture clashes and even how to laugh about it later!

A quick example he once took me for a 2 night retreat to the mountainous region of Germany and whilst there, i was naked in the hot sauna to which he remarked,""My God you are really black!""...

I made a fuss about it all day but ofcourse at the back of my mind, i knew he only meant that my skin looked dark especially compared to the very white sauna i was in at that moment and the snow covering the whole mountain behind the very shiny glass window, me sitting there in the middle of all this white was like a small black fullstop on a very white piece of paper. The mountain behind me was huge and covered in snow, I get it...

I knew exactly what he had meant, it was innocent BUT coming from Tanzania a country that was once under German rule before the Brirish took over and further colonized us, the horror stories you grow up learning from your grandmother which they learnt from their grandmothers, generational stories about the German soldiers, there was just something about a white man...a strong looking German standing tall infront of my naked vulnerable body remarking about my blackness that just felt a type of way. 

To be quite honest, for a moment there, my survival instincts shot up, my adrenaline had shot up. I was in fight or flight mode. I was ready to defend myself and my blood had boiled alittle. Just a subconscious response i suppose. 

These things take time from both sides. Both sides are programmed differently for years on a belief system, blacks and whites are both conditioned by media, by school, by politics etc. so yeah that's that. It just happens.

But we worked that out and were soon fucking in the sauna like there had not been any fight Lol! 

In short we get along just fine. We have these small moments but we get past them coz at the end of the day, he is really just a nice guy!

Everything is fine, well, that was until one of us fell in love!!! Yours truly! I didn't see it coming. It just happened i swear. Out of freaking nowhere!

So I asked him how he felt about me and his answer was,""Well, i certainly have grown feelings for you too""

Then we started getting into fights mostly fueled by jealousy! We were fine before but once we had that ""feelings talk"" now we are even fighting about the age gap between us something that never bothered any of us before!!!

Well fast forward, i broke up with him (over some stupid text he got from an ex! Something so stupid! And if i am being honest, i just wanted to see if he would chase me! Foolish of me) He never did! 

He only wrote,""U know she must talk to me over the son who we share but if you will dump me coz of this, then fine! I won't choose u over my boy and talking to his mom. I have to talk to his mom from time to time about his welfare. You know this but whatever Good luck!"" 

That was 2 months ago guys! Today i texted him Merry Xmas. He replied,""Merry xmas to you too. Thank you for remembering me. I wish you a good holiday""

I am a  year old Tanzanian lady... He is a  year old German gentleman. It started out pretty casual between us. Sex, then he drops me off at my apartment, might buy me a gift or two on the way there, might not, might call me later on to say goodnight, might not. More sex...going out to eat or dance in the city, sex and then he drops me to my place...might call, might not. None of us really had a problem with this casual arrangement. It was simple &amp; nice. No complications. I liked him, he liked me. Its been  months of knowing one another. 

We were both single fresh out of abusive relationships and so thought to ourselves to keep it casual between us &amp; see where it goes without forcing anything 

Ofcourse the obvious cultural clashes in the beginning like any interracial couple experiences but we learnt to navigate our way through our differences and find a way around such natural culture clashes and even how to laugh about it later!

A quick example he once took me for a  night retreat to the mountainous region of Germany and whilst there, i was naked in the hot sauna to which he remarked,My God you are really black!...

I made a fuss about it all day but ofcourse at the back of my mind, i knew he only meant that my skin looked dark especially compared to the very white sauna i was in at that moment and the snow covering the whole mountain behind the very shiny glass window, me sitting there in the middle of all this white was like a small black fullstop on a very white piece of paper. The mountain behind me was huge and covered in snow, I get it...

I knew exactly what he had meant, it was innocent BUT coming from Tanzania a country that was once under German rule before the Brirish took over and further colonized us, the horror stories you grow up learning from your grandmother which they learnt from their grandmothers, generational stories about the German soldiers, there was just something about a white man...a strong looking German standing tall infront of my naked vulnerable body remarking about my blackness that just felt a type of way. 

To be quite honest, for a moment there, my survival instincts shot up, my adrenaline had shot up. I was in fight or flight mode. I was ready to defend myself and my blood had boiled alittle. Just a subconscious response i suppose. 

These things take time from both sides. Both sides are programmed differently for years on a belief system, blacks and whites are both conditioned by media, by school, by politics etc. so yeah thats that. It just happens.

But we worked that out and were soon fucking in the sauna like there had not been any fight Lol! 

In short we get along just fine. We have these small moments but we get past them coz at the end of the day, he is really just a nice guy!

Everything is fine, well, that was until one of us fell in love!!! Yours truly! I didnt see it coming. It just happened i swear. Out of freaking nowhere!

So I asked him how he felt about me and his answer was,Well, i certainly have grown feelings for you too

Then we started getting into fights mostly fueled by jealousy! We were fine before but once we had that feelings talk now we are even fighting about the age gap between us something that never bothered any of us before!!!

Some people are unapologetically themselves, whether they are talking to a complete stranger or someone they've known their entire lives. Others, not so much.

I personally have 5 stages.

**Stage 1**: How I interact with people I'll likely never see again. At most, they may get a couple of words from me. But a simple grunt or complete silence is normal too for me. 

**Stage 2**: How I interact with people I may see regularly, but never actually get to know. Like a person who works in the same building but for a different company. If I see them almost every morning because we come in at the same time, I may engage in some boring small talk if they initiate, simply to be friendly. But nothing more.

**Stage 3:** Reserved for people I see regularly and may need to talk to regularly. Think classmates or coworkers. I have more in depth conversations, throw out some lighthearted jokes, etc. When dating, I also start at stage 3 as well. This stage is critical for me though. It's where I determine whether or not I see the relationship/friendship has potential to develop. If it doesn't, that person permanently gets stage 3 me. If I can see myself being friends with this person, or being in a relationship with them, it starts to gradually move into stage 4 over a few months.

**Stage 4:** Probably me at my best. My friends, girlfriends, and family are the only ones who see it. Or if I'm with my friends and they have their friends there, those people will witness it too. But like I said, it can take a little while before people see this side of me.

(if these details matter, we are the same age group. I am a Stem major while he is a humanities major. He is a gamer and a anime fan, so am I though I lean more on anime and he leans more on gaming. I am an avarage looking woman. I am thin with a large busy and a bit below avarage height. he is tall and slightly chubby.)


so far I have made these moves:

1-) I gave him baked goods so he had some snacks during a long twitch stream

2-) I told him I found his nail polish very cute, and I liked his lack of toxic masculinity.

3-) I invited him to cook together and spent time with him.

4-) I invited him and another friend to have tea and chat.

5-) I invited him on a walk (this one he declined, due to corona concerns he said)

these happened during the course of 2 months. I dont want to constantly ask him to spend time together since that could come off as creepy and we are neighbours so I want to play it safe. I cant tell if he can tell that I like him. please tell me should I;

1-) Assume he got the message but doesnt like me back and stop pursuing him

2-) keep “testing the water” by making up excuses to hang out

3-) Ask him out.

if these details matter, we are the same age group. I am a Stem major while he is a humanities major. He is a gamer and a anime fan, so am I though I lean more on anime and he leans more on gaming. I am an avarage looking woman. I am thin with a large busy and a bit below avarage height. he is tall and slightly chubby.


so far I have made these moves:

- I gave him baked goods so he had some snacks during a long twitch stream

- I told him I found his nail polish very cute, and I liked his lack of toxic masculinity.

- I invited him to cook together and spent time with him.

- I invited him and another friend to have tea and chat.

- I invited him on a walk this one he declined, due to corona concerns he said

these happened during the course of  months. I dont want to constantly ask him to spend time together since that could come off as creepy and we are neighbours so I want to play it safe. I cant tell if he can tell that I like him. please tell me should I;

- Assume he got the message but doesnt like me back and stop pursuing him

- keep testing the water by making up excuses to hang out

- Ask him out.

And if I should keep on pursuing him, how should I do that?",1592,317,5.022082018927445,2020,12,24,23,0,0.05,0.819,0.131,POSITIVE,0.8803050518035889,1

I think about changing careers but then there’s nothing I think I could justify jumping into that would be worth it. So I think to myself is this it?

Outside of work I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Have been coming up on 7 years almost.

It’s something that’s on my mind at all hours and a very big part of my identity. The reason I’m disclosing this is because it’s my dream to be able to have my own gym and students one day when I get close to or actually get my black belt, which is about 5 years off maybe. I’d like to do this overseas, somewhere like Vietnam, Malaysia or somewhere in SouthEast Asia where the sport is still in a growth phase - I spent a lot of time training there in the past. I’m not looking to make bank obviously , but if I could make enough to live comfortably somewhere like that, I’d consider it a success.

I get this almost euphoric feeling when I think about actually pulling it off. Then another voice in my head tells me to be responsible, stay in the safe job, build up a steady retirement fund, and that I’m throwing away a comfortable life to chase a dream when I don’t even know if it’ll work out.

My entire life I’ve been a bit of an overachiever, and this has suited (and maybe even masked?) how much I have a hard time focusing on things. Not like in the minute to minute sense, but in terms of not being able to do the same thing every day. In fact, I’m so good at minute to minute focus that I wouldn’t have ever said I have bad focus until maybe last year when I started realizing a lifelong pattern. 

In undergrad and in my master’s program I always took the most classes allowed. This way I always could change what I was thinking about and do the other work later. I worked 20-30h/week on top of it, so i never had time to get so bored of any one thing that I avoided it. 

Then, I worked for a while as a high school teacher and found it really exciting for a few years, but again, I found myself sick of what I do as soon as it was predictable. I knew the lesson plans by heart, so I tried to keep it interesting with new labs and always making changes to prior assignments. At that point I had to do something else and didn’t know what so I went back to school. 

I went to get a PhD and was entertained for a while, but at this point—as many people getting PhDs can confirm—the classes aren’t that hard (or else I wouldn’t try for a PhD) but I’m so sick of the actual parts of what I do that makes my salary/boosts my resume. Stuff like publications, consulting with research institutes, and working for the university teaching/grading/etc. 

I work on the same half dozen research projects day in and day out, and I’ve been doing the same projects for 2+ years. I hate to say, but it’s so boring. I find myself doing anything to give myself an excuse to avoid this work. 

At the same time, I get excited to produce *the literal same type of content* (I do applied statistics more or less so I can do it with any data that interests me) on my own website or on a new project that I see I can quickly turn around. 

I just can’t seem to enjoy returning to any old work. Anything monotonous just makes me avoid the task completely. I feel like this is so unsustainable and have no idea what to do. I can’t just do something new every time I work on something; I know I need to build off / improve old work to do anything important with my career, but I am sick of it.

But I want a relationship with a woman. But all I've got to go on is two years of basically just mashing our happy parts together and tolerating each other lol is that all it is?

This guy who I'll call Taz, has been with us for almost a year now. I'm 23 and he's 34. I never liked this guy. He has an attitude, he's ignorant, and immature. He makes a lot of dumb comments. Today he asked me, ""Where are your non-slip shoes?"" Working in food service, you have to wear non-slip shoes. I was like, ""I'm wearing my non-slip shoes."" He was like, ""Those ain't non-slip."" I was like, ""They are fool."" I showed him my soles to prove him wrong. He then said, ""Those shoes raggedy as hell."" I was offended.

We got new shoes through the company, but I don't want to wear them yet, because the shoes I have now I think are still in good condition. They're Skechers. He then asked me, ""Where your new shoes? You sold them?"" I was like, ""No they're at home, in my closet."" He was like, ""Nah you probably sold them."" Him and the manager started laughing. The manager is also pissing me off because I feel like he enables him. I feel like I'm being picked on.

He thinks I'm lame for not drinking and smoking everyday. I don't smoke and I drink occasionally. He also said I'm lame as hell for not having Social Media (besides Reddit). He's very judgmental.

Like I said, he has an attitude. My main responsibility is Utility. I wash dishes, clean the dining area, etc. He does prep. We work right next to each other. The dish tank is very close to the prep table. One time when I was washing dishes, I accidentally splashed dish water on him. It wasn't a lot of water, just a little bit. I immediately apologized but he got an attitude with me. He was like, ""What the f&amp;ck is your problem?"" I didn't appreciate him speaking to me that way, but I didn't have the balls to confront him.

I don't know what his problem is. I went outside one time to pick up a delivery and Taz came out too (He was on break) and he yells ""DCT1997 WHAT THE F&amp;CK ARE YOU STANDING OUTSIDE FOR? !"". When I come into work he asks me ""What the f&amp;ck are you doing here?"" I'm like, ""I'm here to work lol."" I swear he has issues.

He's also VERY over sexual. He openly cheats on his girlfriend. He always brags about the women he has sex with. He always tells us about the female customers and managers that he wants to bang. He calls women b&amp;tches and h&amp;es. My manager and coworkers think it's funny, but I think it's inappropriate for the workplace.

Whenever he makes a mistake on something, he tries to blame me.

He admits to being a thief. Although I never caught him stealing anything there.

He's also arrogant. He brags about how he's such a good worker and how our cafe would be nothing without him. He always says, ""I'm the king of this place."" It irritates me because I hate people who brag.

When the health inspector comes, he always tries to hide from her because he doesn't want her questioning him.

He's also so stupid. He paid $2,000 on a car he didn't need while he already has a car in good condition. His excuse was ""You can never have too many cars."" We were having a debate once, and he was trying to convince me that the sea is bigger than the ocean. It's common sense to know that the ocean is bigger than the sea. We Googled it and I was right, but he still didn't want to believe me. He says he'll never take a day off, even if he's sick.

I had enough of him. I wanted him gone since he started. However, everyone seems to like him. They all think he's funny, etc. He gets along well with everyone. I feel like the only one who doesn't like him. I also feel like he targets me specifically. I try to ignore him, but he won't stop talking to me.

He has come at me side ways a couple of times and he always makes stupid comments to me. Everyone, including the manager laughs. I laugh them off because I don't want to get into a commotion, but the comments put me off.

She didn't punch me or anything that left bruises, but she would poke me hard in the ribs, pull my hair (head, legs, even armpit hair), or pinch me and then call me dramatic or downplay my reaction. For a long time, I thought it was normal. I had to endure this pain because men aren't supposed to complain about these things. But if I so much as tickle her by accident it's a crime against humanity. 

It wasn't until years later, i hadn't been with her in quite some time that i realised that was a form of abuse. Not sure if i would call it gaslighting, but it was something similar I guess. Flash forward to me being in a new relationship and my gf jabs me in the eye one day while we were in bed. It was an accident, but I said ""hey watch your finger"" and she replied with ""you're being dramatic"". Instant trigger for me, but I'm not the type to lash out. So I just told her ""I don't appreciate you saying that"". She didn't respond and we fell asleep. 

I wasn't sure if I should bring that up to her or not, so I spoke to a close friend about it. She immediately told me that I was indeed being over dramatic about it all and that I need to ""pick my battles"". This wasn't one of those silly lovers quarrel moments where you just shake your head and move on, at least not for me. I felt like my concerns got downplayed yet again because I'm a man. She picked up on my mood change and started apologizing, but I just told her to drop it. I'll speak to my gf if it happens again.

She's reasonably timid and chipper, which I not only find attractive but is also refreshing compared to many of the other girls there. If things go tits up and I get rejected however, it's not too bad in terms of working there, as we don't have to work near one another.

I've usually had the most success with women taking an interest in me first, but I need to make the first move here, and there is so much advice conflicting with each other and my own intuition that I'm not sure what 1st step to take. I'll leave it here and wait for help, but I would just like to put forward some of the advice I've learned which makes it confusing, which I'll put after my sign-off.

It’s not just 2 or 3 accounts, it’s like 200 “models” and all the pictures are girls in very tiny clothes and in suggesting poses/faces...It’s basically very softporn. No judgements, I just really really want to UNDERSTAND why. Why is it so necessary to watch many different girls all the time, everyday, why is not enough the ones that are already being followed, do you guys needs to get aroused all the time? Why do I feel a weird disgust in my stomach for this?

I don’t buy the “men are visual and wired to look at naked women all the time” or “it’s simple we like pretty girls”, yeah but what’s the point? It’s to get that dopamine rush? It’s to fill a hole in your heart for lack of female love? It’s thirst/desperation? If It’s jerk off material do you guys really need that many? Do you feel like you’re objectifying them? (Cause the accounts are only tits ass pretty face images...they don’t really show their soul or personalities)

 Do you think about if someday you have a daughter and she chooses to model on social media for dudes to jerk off for her or to serve as an eye candy for men as a profession... would you feel totally ok with that? No sexism but I really don’t wanna teach this for my future daughter and I’m scared that actually all men are like that!

It’s not just  or  accounts, it’s like  models and all the pictures are girls in very tiny clothes and in suggesting poses/faces...It’s basically very softporn. No judgements, I just really really want to UNDERSTAND why. Why is it so necessary to watch many different girls all the time, everyday, why is not enough the ones that are already being followed, do you guys needs to get aroused all the time? Why do I feel a weird disgust in my stomach for this?

I don’t buy the men are visual and wired to look at naked women all the time or it’s simple we like pretty girls, yeah but what’s the point? It’s to get that dopamine rush? It’s to fill a hole in your heart for lack of female love? It’s thirst/desperation? If It’s jerk off material do you guys really need that many? Do you feel like you’re objectifying them? Cause the accounts are only tits ass pretty face images...they don’t really show their soul or personalities

 Do you think about if someday you have a daughter and she chooses to model on social media for dudes to jerk off for her or to serve as an eye candy for men as a profession... would you feel totally ok with that?

\- embroidering an outline of a picture of us. (but idk would it be weird to have a pic of people cuddling on a sweater?)

\- anniversary date 

\- a quote? (idk what quote would be like not cringe though so suggestions welcome)
